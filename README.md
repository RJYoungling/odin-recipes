Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. I'll create a basic website and am hoping to get more comfortable with Git and GitHub. It's a lot at the moment, so I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all.

By the end of the project I'm hoping to have a better understanding of how to use HTML, CSS, perhaps Javascript as well, and how to use Git and Github.
